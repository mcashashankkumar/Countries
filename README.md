# REST Countries API with color theme switcher

## Overview
The challenge is to integrate with the REST Countries API to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

## The challenge
User should be able to:

See all countries from the API on the homepage
Search for a country using an input field
Filter countries by region
Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
Click through to the border countries on the detail page
Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode (optional)

## Install and Run the app

just download it to your computer
* open the terminal and run following commmands
* change directory into `cd Countries`
* run `npm install` in your terminal
* run `npm start` 
* The browser should automatically open the app. If it doesn't, navigate to http://localhost:3000/

## My process

 ## Getting Started with Create React App

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
